        <p>
          I am a resourceful and driven software engineer with great technical
          intuition and a deep understanding of embedded systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          With 11+ years as an architectural lighting designer, I&nbsp;developed
          skills in project management, detail-oriented documentation, systems
          troubleshooting, and a sense for the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&nbsp;am a maker with a hands-on approach and a discerning focus on
          quality and process improvement.
