        <h1>Hola! I'm Ã“scar</h1>
        <p>
          I am a resourceful and driven software engineer with great technical
          intuition and a discerning focus on quality and process improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 11+ years as a lighting designer, I am transitioning to software
          engineering with strong skills in detail-oriented documentation,
          systems troubleshooting, project management, and great empathy for the
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a relentless maker and inquisitive learner who is always looking
          under the hood, and am passionate about smart lighting, embedded
          systems, and the IoT.
