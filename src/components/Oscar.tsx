        <h1>Hola! I'm Ã“scar</h1>
        <p>
          I am a resourceful and driven software engineer with great technical
          intuition and a deep understanding of embedded systems. After an
          11-year career in architectural consulting, I&nbsp;developed a strong
          knowledge of lighting technologies and control systems, and a keen
          sense for the user experience. I&nbsp;am a maker with a hands-on
          approach and a discerning focus on quality and process improvement.
